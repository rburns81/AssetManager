AssetManager
============

I started working on this project a few months ago, but only got serious about it recently.  We are trying to finish a Windows 7 migration and this is to keep track of our progress.  I plan to expand this to include more general asset tracking features and fields, such as serial numbers and license keys.  I went through a few iterations to get to this point.  Most of the old files are in the obsolete folder, but it all pre-dates version control, so it's really just a hodge-podge of test pages and unfactored code.
